Once upon a time, at some point I started being very enthusiastic about computers 
and programming. I was programming games in machine language for Sinclair ZX81. 
One of my games won a 3rd prize in the competition for "Best program", organized
by a magazine for popular science. The game was written for ZX81 with 1KB RAM. 

This project is a reincarnation of the same game, written in JavaScript, as an 
exercise.  

The project is built and tested in continuous integration and the last 
version from master branch is automatically deployed to http://kapsula.isokissa.org 
Go there and play!

Design
------

One of the goals of this project is to prove that it is possible to make a 
fully automatically testable arcade game. The software design allows clear layering of 
responsibilities.
