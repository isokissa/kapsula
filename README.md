Kapsula
=======

Once upon a time, at some point I started being very enthusiastic about computers 
and programming. I was programming games in machine language for Sinclair ZX81. 
One of my games won a 3rd prize in the competition for "Best program", organized
by a magazine for popular science. The game was written for ZX81 with 1KB RAM. 

This project is a reincarnation of the same game, written in JavaScript, as an 
exercise.
